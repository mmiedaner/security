# PMAT - Post Message Attack Tool

PMAT is a simple HTML page to demonstrate vulnerabilities within the 
implementation of event handlers for the "message" or "onmessage" 
events. These are normally generated by the window.postMessage(someMessage, someURL).
Within this page you will be able to load two iframes. 
One being the victim to which you will send your message to. 

## Sending messages from the page itself
1. Configure your victim frame.
2. Configure the message and domain you would like to send.
3. Press the "Load victim frame" button.
4. Press the "Send message" button right next to the 
"Load victim frame" button.

And that's it ;)

## Sending messages from a special frame
1. Configure your victim frame.
2. Configure the message and domain you would like to send.
3. Press the "Load victim frame" button.
4. Press the "Load attack frame" button.
5. Press the "Send message" button right next to the 
"Load attack frame" button.

Of course you may as well send a message from the page itself in this scenario 
- simply use the other "Send message" button.
