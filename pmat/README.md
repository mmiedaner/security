## PMAT - Post Message Attack Tool

PMAT is a simple HTML page to demonstrate vulnerabilities within the implementation of event handlers for the
"message" or "onmessage" events. These are normally generated by the window.postMessage(someMessage, someURL).
Within this page you will be able to load two iframes. One being the victim to which you will send your message
to.
